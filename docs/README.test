== Writing Tests

1. There are actually *4* core test suites:

   a) org.jruby.test.MainTestSuite, a suite of pure-java tests;

   b) org.jruby.test.TestUnitTestSuite, which runs a suite of files named
   one-per-line in test/jruby_index (and other test/*_index files).
   Note: some are commented out.

   c) 'Rubyspecs', fetched directly from Rubyspec project. The specs
   are written in rspec format and aim to test conformance of JRuby
   against the Ruby specification.

   d) MRI's own tests, synced periodically. The tests are run with
   rake test:mri19 and known failing tests are marked as such in 
   excludes files under test/externals/ruby1.9/excludes.

2. If you'd like to contribute new tests, we'd prefer you write them via the
rubyspecs project.  If the tests are very specific to JRuby (like Java
Integration) we prefer writing rspecs under our specs directory.

3. We're also interested in running tests for other ruby software suites; if
you want to grab your favorite ruby software and run its own tests under JRuby
and report to the mailing list at dev@jruby.codehaus.org, that would be great.

4. Please file any and all patches in JIRA:
http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY

== Running Tests

Using ant, type

  ant test

The three test suites should be run in order.

To run rubyspecs, type

  ant spec

A slightly shorter run we run frequently is:

  ant spec-short

The rubyspecs will be fetched over the net, and then executed.

To run an individual test:
 run `ant install-dev-gems` which will install bin/rspec for use.
 run `ant test` to compile the java fixtures (you don't need to wait for the tests to finish)
 then test as normal with `bin/rspec spec/path-to-spec`
