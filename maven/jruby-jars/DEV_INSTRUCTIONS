In order to build a new jruby-jars gem, here is the process:

* Run 'rake gem'

The 'update' task will update version.rb and create the jar files.
You may commit the contents of the version.rb file, but it is not a requirement.
However update should always be run before building the gem to ensure the latest code is pulled in.
