<!--

Thank you for submitting a pull request to the JRuby project! Your help means a lot to us!

Please make sure you are targeting the correct branch:

* Most bug fixes should target `jruby-9.4` as that is our current maintenance release JRuby 9.4.
* Ruby 3.2, 3.3, or 3.4 compatibility fixes should target `master`, which is the branch for JRuby 10. Most performance fixes should also go to `master`.
* We will accept fixes for JRuby 9.3 (branch `jruby-9.3`) but that version is EOL and may not get new releases.

All branches are merged forward to the next major release (e.g. 9.4 is merged to master/10) as needed for releases.

If you have questions, please just submit as best you can and we will assist.

We also request that current users of JRuby add themselves to our user
list by submitting a pull request to the following file:

* https://github.com/jruby/jruby/blob/master/USERS.md

This helps the JRuby community grow and share best practices and new ideas
for how to apply JRuby to JVM and Ruby apps around the world.
