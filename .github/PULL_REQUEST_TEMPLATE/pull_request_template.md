<!--

Thank you for submitting a pull request to the JRuby project! Your help means a lot to us!

Please make sure you are targeting the correct branch:

* Most bug fixes should target `jruby-9.4` as that is our current maintenance release JRuby 9.4.
* Ruby 3.2, 3.3, or 3.4 compatibility fixes should target `master`, which is the branch for JRuby 10. Most performance fixes should also go to `master`.
* We will accept fixes for JRuby 9.3 (branch `jruby-9.3`) but that version is EOL and may not get new releases.

All branches are merged forward to the next major release (e.g. 9.4 is merged to master/10) as needed for releases.

If you have questions, please just submit as best you can and we will assist.
