/**
 * This interface should be implemented by writers of Java extensions to JRuby.
 * The basicLoad method will get called exactly once, the first time this extension
 * gets loaded. It is therefore prudent that it established the environment
 * the extension wants to have. For example, creating new Modules and Classes,
 * adding methods to these and describe which implementation will get used.
 *
 * This interface details the standard load mechanism for easy extensions.
 * Implement the interface in a class outlined in the JavaDoc for LoadService,
 * put the class into a jar-file and put it on JRuby's load path, and you're
 * set to go.
