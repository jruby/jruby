/**
 * A Frame holds per-call information that needs to persist outside the
 * execution of a given method. Currently a frame holds the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The class against which this method is being invoked. This is usually
 * (always?) the class of "self" within this call.</li>
 * <li>The current "self" for the call.</li>
 * <li>The name of the method being invoked during this frame, used for
 * backtraces and "super" invocations.</li>
 * <li>The block passed to this invocation. If the given code body can't
 * accept a block, it will be Block.NULL_BLOCK.</li>
 * <li>Whether this is the frame used for a binding-related call like eval. This
 * is used to determine where to terminate evaled code's backtrace.</li>
 * <li>The current visibility for methods defined during this call. Starts out
 * as PUBLIC by default (in most cases) and can be modified by appropriate
 * Kernel.public/private/protected calls.</li>
 * <li>The jump target marker for non-local returns.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Frames are allocated for all Ruby methods (in compatibility mode, default)
 * and for some core methods. In general, a frame is required for a method to
 * show up in a backtrace, and so some methods only use frame for backtrace
 * information (so-called "backtrace frames").
