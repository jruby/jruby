/**
 * Operands extending this type can make a reasonable assumption of 
 * immutability.  In Ruby, almost nothing is truly immutable (set_instance_var)
 * but for the sake of our compiler we can assume the basic behavior will 
 * continue to work unchanged (the value of an instance of fixnum 3 will remain 
 * 3).
 * 
 * Knowing that we have a literal which will not change can be used for 
 * optimizations like constant propagation.
 * 
 * ENEBO: This cachedObject thing obviously cannot be used from multiple
 * threads without some safety being added.  This probably also is not the
 * fastest code, but it is very simple.  It would be really nice to make this
 * side-effect free as well, but this is difficult without adding a level of
 * indirection or pre-caching each value we encounter during construction.
