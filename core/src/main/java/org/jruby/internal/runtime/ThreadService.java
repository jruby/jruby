/**
 * ThreadService maintains references to all JRuby-specific thread data structures
 * needed for Ruby's threading API and for JRuby's execution. The main
 * structures are:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>ThreadContext, which contains frames, scopes, etc needed for Ruby execution</li>
 * <li>RubyThread, the Ruby object representation of a thread's state</li>
 * <li>RubyThreadGroup, which represents a group of Ruby threads</li>
 * <li>RubyNativeThread, used to wrap threads owned by the current Ruby runtime</li>
 * <li>AdoptedNativeThread, used to wrap threads managed outside of JRuby</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * In order to ensure these structures do not linger after the thread has terminated,
 * most of them are either weakly or softly referenced. The references associated
 * with these structures are:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>ThreadService is itself a ThreadLocal, which holds a soft reference
 * to a ThreadContext. So the thread's locals softly reference ThreadContext.
 * We use a soft reference to keep ThreadContext instances from going away too
 * quickly when a Java thread leaves Ruby space completely, which would otherwise
 * result in a lot of ThreadContext object churn.</li>
 * <li>ThreadService maintains a weak map from the actual java.lang.Thread instance
 * to the associated RubyThread. The map is weak-keyyed, so it will not prevent the
 * collection of the associated Thread. The associated RubyThread will remain alive as
 * long as the Thread and this ThreadService instance are both alive, maintaining
 * the external thread's identity in Ruby-land.</li>
 * <li>RubyThread has a weak reference to its to ThreadContext.</li>
 * <li>ThreadContext has a hard reference to its associated RubyThread. Ignoring other
 * references, this will usually mean RubyThread is softly reachable via the
 * soft threadlocal reference to ThreadContext in ThreadService.</li>
 * <li>RubyThreadGroup has hard references to threads it owns. The thread removes
 * itself on termination (if it's a Ruby thread) or when the ThreadContext is
 * collected (as in the case of "adopted" Java threads.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * These data structures can come to life in one of two ways:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>A Ruby thread is started. This constructs a new RubyThread object, which
 * calls to ThreadService to initialize a ThreadContext and appropriate mappings
 * in all ThreadService's structures. The body of the thread is wrapped with a
 * finally block that will forcibly unregister the thread and all related
 * structures from ThreadService.</li>
 * <li>A Java thread enters Ruby by doing a call. The thread is "adopted", and
 * gains a RubyThread instance, a ThreadContext instance, and all associated
 * mappings in ThreadService. Since we don't know when the thread has "left"
 * Ruby permanently, no forcible unregistration is attempted for the various
 * structures and maps. However, they should not be hard-rooted; the
 * ThreadContext is only softly reachable at best if no calls are in-flight,
 * so it will collect. Its collection will release the reference to RubyThread,
 * and its finalizer will unregister that RubyThread from its RubyThreadGroup.
 * With the RubyThread gone, the Thread-to-RubyThread map will eventually clear,
 * releasing the hard reference to the Thread itself.</li>
 * <ul>

     * thread stays alive much longer. We use SoftReference here because
     * WeakReference is collected too quickly, resulting in very expensive
     * ThreadContext churn (and this originally lead to JRUBY-2261's leak of
     * adopted RubyThread instances).
