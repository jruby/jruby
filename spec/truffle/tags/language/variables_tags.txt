fails:Basic assignment calls to_a on the given argument when using a splat
fails:Basic assignment allows assignment through lambda
fails:Basic multiple assignment with a single RHS value does not call #to_ary on an Array subclass instance
fails:Basic multiple assignment with a single RHS value does not call #to_a on an Array subclass instance
fails:Basic multiple assignment with a single RHS value calls #to_ary on an object
fails:Basic multiple assignment with a splatted single RHS value does not call #to_ary on an Array subclass instance
fails:Basic multiple assignment with a splatted single RHS value does not call #to_a on an Array subclass instance
fails:Basic multiple assignment with a splatted single RHS value calls #to_a on an object if #to_ary is not defined
fails:Assigning multiple values calls #to_ary on RHS arg if the corresponding LHS var is a splat
fails:Assigning multiple values allows complex parallel assignment
fails:Conditional operator assignment 'obj.meth op= expr' is equivalent to 'obj.meth op obj.meth = expr'
fails:Conditional operator assignment 'obj.meth op= expr' may not assign at all, depending on the truthiness of lhs
fails:Operator assignment 'obj.meth op= expr' evaluates lhs one time
fails:Unconditional operator assignment 'obj[idx] op= expr' is equivalent to 'obj[idx] = obj[idx] op expr'
fails:Conditional operator assignment 'obj[idx] op= expr' may not assign at all, depending on the truthiness of lhs
fails:Operator assignment 'obj[idx] op= expr' handles empty index (idx) arguments
fails:Operator assignment 'obj[idx] op= expr' handles complex index (idx) arguments
fails:Operator assignment 'obj[idx] op= expr' handles empty splat index (idx) arguments
fails:Operator assignment 'obj[idx] op= expr' handles single splat index (idx) arguments
fails:Operator assignment 'obj[idx] op= expr' handles multiple splat index (idx) arguments
fails:Operator assignment 'obj[idx] op= expr' handles splat index (idx) arguments with normal arguments
fails:Operator assignment 'obj[idx] op= expr' returns result of rhs not result of []=
fails:Multiple assignments with grouping A group on the lhs is considered one position and treats its corresponding rhs position like an Array
fails:Multiple assignments with grouping supports multiple levels of nested groupings
fails:Multiple assignment has the proper return value
fails:Multiple assignment, array-style returns an array of all rhs values
