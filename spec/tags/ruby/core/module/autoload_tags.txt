fails(conflicting state changes for failed load and autoload):Module#autoload does not remove the constant from Module#constants if load raises a RuntimeError and keeps it as an autoload
hangs(incompatible locking in autoload):Module#autoload during the autoload before the constant is assigned returns nil in autoload thread and returns the path in other threads for Module#autoload?
