fails(conflicting state changes for failed load and autoload):Module#autoload does not remove the constant from Module#constants if load raises a RuntimeError and keeps it as an autoload
hangs(incompatible locking in autoload):Module#autoload during the autoload before the constant is assigned returns nil in autoload thread and returns the path in other threads for Module#autoload?
fails:Module#autoload removes the constant from Module#constants if the loaded file does not define it
fails:Module#autoload after autoloading searches for the constant like the original lookup looks up in parent scope after failed autoload
hangs:Module#autoload during the autoload after the constant is assigned returns nil in autoload thread and returns the path in other threads for Module#autoload?
fails:Module#autoload during the autoload after the constant is assigned returns the real constant location in autoload thread and returns the autoload location in other threads for Module#const_source_location
fails(low priority excluded from JRuby 10):Module#autoload after autoloading searches for the constant like the original lookup warns once in verbose mode if the constant was defined in a parent scope
