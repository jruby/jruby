## About

JRuby is an implementation of the [Ruby language](http://www.ruby-lang.org)
using the JVM.

It aims to be a complete, correct and fast implementation of Ruby, at the same
time as providing powerful new features such as concurrency without a
[global-interpreter-lock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Interpreter_Lock),
true parallelism, and tight integration to the Java language to allow you to
use Java classes in your Ruby program and to allow JRuby to be embedded into a
Java application.

You can use JRuby simply as a faster version of Ruby, you can use it to run Ruby
on the JVM and access powerful JVM libraries such as highly tuned concurrency
primitives, you can use it to embed Ruby as a scripting language in your Java
program, or many other possibilites.

We're a welcoming community - you can talk to us on [#jruby on Freenode](http://richard.esplins.org/siwi/2011/07/08/getting-started-freenode-irc/).
There are core team members in the EU and US time zones.

Visit the [JRuby website](http://jruby.org) and the [JRuby wiki](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki)
for more information.

## Getting JRuby

To run JRuby you will need a JRE (the JVM runtime environment) version 7 or higher.

Your operating system may provide a JRE and JRuby in a package manager, but you may find that this
version is very old.

An alternative is to use one of the Ruby version managers.

For [`rbenv`](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) you will need the
[`ruby-build`](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build) plugin. You may find that your system
package manager can provide these. Then you can run:

```
$ rbenv install jruby-9.0.5.0
```

For [`rvm`](https://rvm.io) you can simply do:

```
$ rvm install jruby
```

You can also [download packages from the JRuby website](http://jruby.org/download) that
you can unpack and run in place.
