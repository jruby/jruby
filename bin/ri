# where name can be

#   Class | Class::method | Class#method | Class.method | method
#
# All names may be abbreviated to their minimum unbiguous form. If a name
# _is_ ambiguous, all valid options will be listed.

# The form '.' method matches either class or instance methods, while

#
# == Installing Documentation
#
# 'ri' uses a database of documentation built by the RDoc utility.
# 
# So, how do you install this documentation on your system?
# It depends on how you installed Ruby.
#
# <em>If you installed Ruby from source files</em> (that is, if it some point
# you typed 'make' during the process :), you can install the RDoc
# documentation yourself. Just go back to the place where you have 
# your Ruby source and type
#
#    make install-doc
#
# You'll probably need to do this as a superuser, as the documentation
# is installed in the Ruby target tree (normally somewhere under 
# <tt>/usr/local</tt>.
#
# <em>If you installed Ruby from a binary distribution</em> (perhaps
# using a one-click installer, or using some other packaging system),
# then the team that produced the package probably forgot to package
# the documentation as well. Contact them, and see if they can add
# it to the next release.
